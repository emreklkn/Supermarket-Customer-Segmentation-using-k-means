# 🛒 Supermarket Customer Segmentation using Clustering

This project aims to segment supermarket customers into distinct groups based on their behavior and demographic attributes. By identifying customer clusters, businesses can tailor their marketing strategies and improve customer targeting.

---

## 📊 Objective

To analyze and segment customers using clustering techniques in order to:
- Understand different customer profiles
- Optimize marketing campaigns
- Enhance decision-making with data-driven insights

---

## 🛠️ Techniques Used

- 📌 **K-Means Clustering**
- 📉 **Elbow Method** (To determine the optimal number of clusters)
- 🎯 **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** (For dimensionality reduction)
- 📈 **Visualization** (Using Matplotlib and Seaborn)

---

## 🧪 Dataset

An example dataset is used which includes customer features such as:
- Age
- Annual Income
- Spending Score
- Gender

Data Source: [Kaggle – Customer Segmentation Datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)

## 📂 Project Files

- `supermarket-customer-segmentation-via-clustering.ipynb`: Main analysis and modeling notebook
- `requirements.txt`: List of required Python libraries

---

## 📷 Sample Visualizations

The notebook contains visualizations such as:
- Elbow Curve to find the optimal number of clusters
- 2D PCA plots to visualize clusters
- Colored scatter plots to represent different customer segments

*(You can add screenshots or plots as `.png` images under an `/images` folder in your repo.)*

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```

3. Open and run `supermarket-customer-segmentation-via-clustering.ipynb`

## 💡 Future Improvements

- Compare with other clustering algorithms (DBSCAN, Hierarchical Clustering)
- Use real-time data for dynamic segmentation
- Build a web dashboard (e.g., with Streamlit or Dash)
- Integrate business rules for automatic campaign triggers
